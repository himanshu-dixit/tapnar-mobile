  <cetner><strong>Terms Of Service</strong></cetner>
<br><br>
  Using our app to do anything other than access the links to this "Terms" page or accessing any page of our website other than our home page and this "Terms" page constitutes your consent to these terms of use and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not consent, do not use our website.
<br><br>
  Your use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading, downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic signature, meaning that you are contractually bound by these terms and by our Privacy Policy.
  Our community rules
<br><br>
  These Terms of Use are our contract with you. We also have community rules, developed thanks to input from the tapnarian community, that serve as guidelines for using tapnar. We welcome your input.
  Stuff not to do
<br><br>
  If someone else might own the copyright to it, don't upload it. Don't upload gore, "hate speech" (i.e. demeaning race, gender, age, religious or sexual orientation, etc.), or material that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, or that encourages violence or crime. Don't upload illegal content such as child porn or nonconsensual ("revenge") porn. Don't hotlink to adult content or to file-sharing, gambling, torrent, warez, or tapnar rip-off sites. Don't impersonate someone else. Also, don't use tapnar to host image libraries you link to from elsewhere, content for your website, advertising, avatars, or anything else that turns us into your content delivery network. If you do – and we will be the judge – or if you do anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you along with the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on tapnar.com. We mean it.
  Stuff to do, please
<br><br>
  Please have tons of fun! That's what tapnar is all about. If something isn't fun -- if you see anything on our site that shouldn't be there because it violates our policies, is illegal (e.g. revenge porn or child porn), or for some other reason, please let us know by emailing us at abuse@tapnar.com.
  About images you upload
<br><br>
  You can upload images anonymously and share them online with only the people you choose to share them with. If you make them publicly available, they may be featured in the gallery. This means that if you upload an image to share with your friend, only your friend will be able to access it online. However, if you share an image with Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, etc., then it may end up in the gallery.
  The Details
  Version 3.3 09/08/2015
  Intellectual Property
<br><br>
  By uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else's rights; and (2) you created the file or other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these terms. With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant tapnar a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content. To the extent that you delete any such file or content from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to tapnar pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content tapnar has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense. Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it.
  USE OF tapnar CONTENT
<br><br>
  By downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from tapnar, you agree that you do not claim any rights to it. The following conditions apply:
<br><br>
  <br>    You may use UGC for personal, non-commercial purposes.
    <br>  You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law, for example journalism (news, comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute ("tapnar" or "courtesy of tapnar") next to where it is displayed.
    <br>  You may not use UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes.
  <br>    Your use of UGC is at your own risk. tapnar MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, and you will indemnify and hold tapnar harmless from any copyright infringement claims arising out of your use of the UGC. (See our general disclaimers below.)
<br><br>
  <br>You may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use.
  <br>NOTICES OF CLAIMED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (OR OTHER TYPES OF INFRINGEMENT)
<br><br>
  <br>If you see anything on our site that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") agent by sending the following information:

      <br>Identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed. IMPORTANT: you must have a registered copyright for the work, or at least have filed with the Copyright Office (http://www.copyright.gov/eco/) an application to register a copyright for the work. DMCA notifications based on unregistered works are not valid.
    <br>  Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed, including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material.
    <br>  A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law.
    <br>  A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right that is allegedly being infringed.
    <br>  Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf.
    <br>  Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone.

  <br><br>Because all DMCA notifications must be based on a work for which the copyright is registered with the Copyright Office (or for which registration has been applied for), and because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are not valid, it will speed our investigation of your DMCA notice if you attach to it a copy of your copyright registration, or registration application, for the work.

  <br><br><br>Our agent to receive such notifications of claimed infringement is Alan Schaaf.

<br><br>
  Use the same procedure for any claimed trademark violations or other infringements. If we receive a DMCA takedown demand for material you posted that we believe constitutes fair use, we will attempt to notify you if we have your contact info; otherwise we are under no obligation to notify you regarding the removal. We reserve the right to refuse to remove any material that in our view constitutes fair use. If we identify you as a "repeat infringer," we will block or remove your images and terminate any accounts you have with us. (If we notify you of a DMCA removal and you respond with a legitimate counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat infringer.) Keep in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of our policies.
  Use of Trademark
<br><br>
  Any uses of our name, trademarks, and logos must follow our Trademark Use Policy.
  Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of Remedies, Indemnity
<br><br>

<br><br>
  Your sole remedy for the loss of any services and/or of any images or other data you may have stored on tapnar's service is to discontinue your use of our service. tapnar WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, tapnar'S SERVICES, EVEN IF tapnar HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF tapnar'S SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER IT OCCURS.
<br><br>
  YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD tapnar AND ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL HARMLESS FROM ALL LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, YOUR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY'S RIGHTS, AND ANY HARM CAUSED TO ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF YOUR UPLOADING OF FILES, COMMENTS, OR ANYTHING ELSE TO OUR SERVERS.
<br><br>  Miscellaneous
<br><br>
  "tapnar" or "we" refers to tapnar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its successors and assigns. "You" refers to any person who has consented to these terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or not at the time. These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between you and tapnar, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise. If any part of these terms is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter, and they will continue to govern any issues that arise out of your use of tapnar's services even after you discontinue using them. We may revise these terms from time to time without notice. Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by changing the version date at the top. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted. tapnar is not meant for use by children under age 13; if your child is younger than 13 please allow him or her to use it only under your supervision.
<br><br>
  Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. See e.g. www.toptenreviews.com/software/security/best-internet-filter-software.
